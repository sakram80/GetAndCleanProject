### Introduction

This Project is about running analysis on different human activities during 
thier usage of Galaxy S4 mobile phone. Project contains one script file for 
the sake of simplicity and understanding the actual code. Besides that it 
includes codebook.txt file which includes all the variables of tidyData set 
generated by run_analysis.R.

### Algorithm design

Algorithm in this file is written in one file run_Analysis.R. To work properly 
user should set working directory with sample data. Working directory should 
include data, train directories and activities_label.txt as well as features.txt.
If working directory does not include these files and directory program will 
through error and it will not produce the desired output. Before starting script 
will load dplyr package and set working direcotry variable as it will be used to 
load data, train and features files for analysis. After this algorith is further
divided into 12 different steps. Before starting each step you will find comments
which will further explain the working of code. These different steps are:

1. Read train data into tables.
2. Combine trainData into columns as first column, subject train, second column.
3. Read test data into tables.
4. Combine testData into columns as first column, subject test, second column.
5. read features_info from file, make put it as column names of new data set.
6. get mean and std columns.
7 read activities.
8. Link activity with labels. 
9. Remove extra columns produced by merging.
10. Give descriptive names to each column, each row contains 3 column names 
in lower camel case.
11. average it one subject and label.
12. export data set
